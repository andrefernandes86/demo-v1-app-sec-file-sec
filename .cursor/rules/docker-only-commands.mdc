# Allowed Terminal Commands

**Only execute Docker-related commands** in this project. No other commands on the host.

## Allowed

- `docker`
- `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`)
- `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker ps`, etc.

## Not allowed on the host

- `python`, `python3`, `pip`, `pytest`
- `npm`, `node`, `yarn`
- Any other non-Docker shell commands

Run the app and tests inside containers (e.g. `docker compose up`, `docker compose --profile test run --rm test`). Do not run Python, pip, or tests directly on the machine where Cursor is running.
